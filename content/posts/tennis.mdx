As young teenager without much athelism, I never had interest in sports or even understood phyical efforts. I was mainly a gamer, deep into Diablo 2. Until a childhood friend and I started watching the an anime named: Prince of Tennis. A classic japanese anime about sports, thought me about how interesting tennis was and how divers in game-style it offered.


## Climbing later on became my next passion.

The discovery of climbing, especially bouldering at Bloc Shop!
